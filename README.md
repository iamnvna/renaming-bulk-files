### Project Six - 100DaysofCode
# Renaming Bulk Files
This is a simple program that renames all the files in a particular folder/directory using a specified naming convention. 

## Background
This project is part of my #100DaysOfCode learning streak. I intend to write a simple python program each day. Each project would:
* be heavily commented for learning purposes;
* include a README file similar to this one;
* include an algorithm to solve it without code;
* include a summary of what I learnt.

## Algorithm
1. Start.
2. Import required library(s).
3. Define a function that include the following block of code:
* Create a global variable to iterate through the folder/directory.
* Declare a path variable to hold the path to the directory where your files are located.
* Specify a naming convention and assign to a variable.
* Specify the source path to each file.
* Specify the destination path to each file.
* From your libray options, rename the files using the source, and destination variables.
4. Run the function.
6. Stop.

## What I've learnt
* This program introduced me to the os python library. The os library is your way to interact with your system OS from the code.
* This program was also my first experience with *if \_\_name__ == "\_\_main__":* conditional statement. I learnt more about it **[here](https://youtu.be/sugvnHA7ElY).** It basically crosschecks to see if the code is being run directly or is imported.
